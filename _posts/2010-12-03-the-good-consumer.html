	I have been giving this title very much thought lately. Last month, my old laptop died for no apparent reason. The screen went black and stayed that way, no startup chime, nothing. Just the super-drive buzz and fans hissing.
	First thing that crossed my mind for troubleshooting was simply resetting all of the three or more capitalized character stuff (SMC, NVRAM, PRAM, ...) and keeping my fingers crossed that nothing worse had happened. No luck there.

	After some (serious) googling I figured that all the symptoms most probably indicate a graphics chip failure (Santa Rosa chipset, Nvidia's fault). What's even better, the replacement logic board comes free of charge!
	The very next day I went down to the local reseller and explained my situation. The first thing funny to me was, that the lady behind the desk was asking me about the user password.

	Three days later I received a phone call from them. They couldn't replace the board, because the computer wouldn't boot and thereby didn't give them some super duper access code to a new logic board. They quoted the replacement cost at 960€, more than the laptop was worth. I thought to myself, I'll take it back, take the hard drive out, snap some photos and be done with it. I took the laptop back to the office and started to disassemble it. Halfway through, my friend Anže came by to take a look. He started blabbering about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Spot">G-Spots</a> and touched the logic board all over while simultaneously pressing the power button. All of a sudden, I heard the familiar startup sound. The computer booted! Still no video, but at least we knew that with the proper software, that super secret replacement code could be accessed. I rang the service right away, telling them about Anže's discovery, instantly asking them if they would be so kind as to try again. They were all up to the challenge so I brought the laptop back to them. Three days later, the new logic board was installed and the laptop was working again. All done free of charge, thanks to Anže and his g-spots.

	The service engineer told me, that they had four similar problems to deal with during the same month all with the undesirable outcome for their customers (logic board couldn't be replaced).

	What I learned from this experience is, that in order for you to be a satisfied customer, you first need to be engrossed in the process as well. We have become way too accustomed to think that the people who know what they are dealing with, will do the right thing. They WILL do the right thing, but only to some extent. We as the customers should be more pressing, more demanding, expecting only the best service, but also be prepared for unexpected results. This is what makes a good consumer - constantly demanding the best from your service, or choosing another, better one. Not only will you as the customer be more satisfied, the service will eventually become better as well.
